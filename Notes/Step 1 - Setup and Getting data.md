# Object Detection with Deep Learning: Face Detection Pipeline

## 1. Introduction to the Face Detection Pipeline

### 1.1 What is Face Detection?

- **Face detection** is a type of object detection where the goal is to locate faces within an image using bounding boxes.
    
- In this tutorial, the objective is to create a **bounding box detection model** to identify a user's face in real-time camera input.
    

### 1.2 Use Cases of Face Detection

- **Facial sentiment analysis**: Determine the emotion on a person's face.
    
- **Facial verification**: Used in security or authentication systems.
    
- **Generic object detection**: The pipeline created can generalize to detect any object, not just faces, provided the object is annotated properly.

## 2. Preparing the Dataset

### 2.1 Dependencies Installation

To set up the environment, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install labelme tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib albumentations
```

#### Explanation of Libraries:

- `labelme`: For annotating images with bounding boxes or other shapes.
    
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the deep learning model.
    
- `opencv-python`: For real-time image capture and video processing.
    
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing results.
    
- `albumentations`: For augmenting images and their labels (bounding boxes).
    

### 2.2 Import Required Python Modules

```python
import os
import time
import uuid
import cv2
```

#### Module Purposes:

- `os`: Manage file paths and directories.
    
- `time`: Create delays between frame captures.
    
- `uuid`: Generate unique filenames for images.
    
- `cv2`: Handle video capture and image writing using OpenCV.
    

### 2.3 Define Directory Structure and Collect Images

- Create a main directory: `data/`
    
    - Subdirectories:
        
        - `images/`: Store captured raw images.
            
        - `labels/`: Store JSON annotations created using labelme.
            
- Later, you'll also create:
    
    - `train/`, `test/`, and `val/` folders to partition data manually.
        

### 2.4 Capturing Images

- Use OpenCV to initialize a video capture device:
    

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # Device 0 or 1 depending on your webcam
```

- Capture 30 images per session using a loop. Example:
    

```python
for img_num in range(30):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    img_name = os.path.join(IMG_PATH, f"{str(uuid.uuid1())}.jpg")
    cv2.imwrite(img_name, frame)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # wait 0.5 seconds to move/adjust face
```

- Move around during capture to increase image variability.
    
- Collect multiple sets (e.g., change shirt, lighting, background) for diversity.

## 3. Annotating Images Using LabelMe

### 3.1 Launch LabelMe Interface

- Run `labelme` in terminal or Jupyter using:
    

```bash
!labelme
```

### 3.2 Load and Annotate

- **Step 1**: Open the `data/images/` folder.
    
- **Step 2**: Set the output directory to `data/labels/`.
    
- **Step 3**: Enable auto-saving (File > Save Automatically).
    
- **Step 4**: For each image:
    
    - Use _Create Rectangle_ to draw a bounding box around the face.
        
    - Label it as `face` (only one class).
        
    - Press `d` to move to the next image.
        
    - Skip annotation if the face is not visible (e.g., face blocked or absent).
        

### 3.3 Annotation Format

- Annotations are saved as `.json` files inside `data/labels/`.
    
- Each file contains:
    

```json
"shapes": [
  {
    "label": "face",
    "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]
  }
]
```

- These points define the top-left and bottom-right corners of the bounding box.

## 4. Summary of Section Accomplished

- Installed all necessary libraries.
    
- Captured a total of 90 images with variable face positions.
    
- Annotated all images using LabelMe with bounding boxes labeled as `face`.
    
- Resulting dataset includes:
    
    - 90 `.jpg` images in `data/images/`
        
    - 90 corresponding `.json` label files in `data/labels/`
        

Next step: You will use `albumentations` to perform data augmentation and prepare your dataset for training a deep learning object detection model.
