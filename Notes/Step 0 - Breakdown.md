# Face Detection Using Object Detection Pipeline - Beginner Friendly Notes

## 1. Introduction to Face Detection via Object Detection

- This tutorial builds a **face detection** model using an **object detection pipeline**, which detects objects (here, faces) using bounding boxes.
    
- It is a **practical and beginner-friendly walkthrough**, and all code is available on GitHub
    
- Object detection has two main components:
    
    - **Classification**: Recognize the type of object (e.g., face).
        
    - **Regression**: Predict the coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) of the bounding box.
        

## 2. Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 2.1 Collecting Data

- Data will be collected using the **webcam**.
    
- Captured images will be saved for further annotation and training.
    

### 2.2 Annotation using LabelMe

- **Annotation** means drawing bounding boxes on the collected images to mark where the face is.
    
- Tool used: `labelme` (preferred over `labelImg`) because it supports:
    
    - Bounding boxes
        
    - Keypoint annotation
        
    - Segmentation
        

### 2.3 Data Augmentation with Albumentations

- **Problem**: 100 images aren't enough for training.
    
- **Solution**: Use `albumentations` to increase dataset size by 30x (e.g., 100 images â†’ 3000).
    
- Transformations applied:
    
    - Random cropping
        
    - Brightness adjustments
        
    - Flipping
        
    - Gamma and RGB shifts
        
- **Important**: Albumentations updates bounding box annotations during transformation automatically.
    

### 2.4 Defining the Model

- The object detection model consists of:
    
    - **Classification Head**: Outputs 1 value (0 or 1) to indicate face detected or not.
        
    - **Regression Head**: Outputs 4 values (x1, y1, x2, y2) for bounding box coordinates.
        

### 2.5 Defining Loss Functions

- Two losses are used to train the model:
    
    - **Binary Cross Entropy Loss**: For classification (detecting if the face is present).
        
    - **Localization Loss** (Regression Loss):
        
        - Compares predicted x1/y1 to true x1/y1 (top-left corner).
            
        - Compares predicted width/height to true width/height (for bounding box shape).
            

### 2.6 Building the Model with Functional API

- Model is built using **TensorFlow Keras Functional API**.
    
- **Base Model**: `VGG16` (a pre-trained model on large datasets).
    
    - The convolutional layers of VGG16 are used to extract features from images.
        
- Custom **Dense layers** are added at the end:
    
    - One for classification (face / no face).
        
    - One for regression (bounding box coordinates).
        

### 2.7 Model Output

- The model outputs **5 values**:
    
    - **1 Classification Output**: A number between 0 and 1 (whether face is detected).
        
    - **4 Regression Outputs**: x1, y1, x2, y2 coordinates for bounding box.
        

### 2.8 Real-Time Testing

- After training, the model can be tested in real-time using webcam.
    
- The bounding box drawn based on predicted coordinates shows where the face is detected in each frame.
    

## 3. Use Cases and Applications

- This object detection framework can be extended to other single-class object detection tasks like:
    
    - Facial sentiment detection
        
    - Identity verification
        
    - Pet detection
        
    - Traffic signs or logos
        

## 4. Key Libraries Used

- **OpenCV** (`cv2`): Captures webcam input and handles images.
    
- **LabelMe**: Annotation tool.
    
- **Albumentations**: Data augmentation.
    
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning framework to build and train models.
